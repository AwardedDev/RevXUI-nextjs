# Getting Started

First, install npm packages

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to start.

# Features
The setup and configuration includes a number of opinionated best-practices in attempt to keep the code clean, safe, and free of bugs.



Code is formatted and linted with each save, if [configured](#ide-configuration), or at least before each commit with the help of husky. 

Tests are configured for both unit and integration tests. Unit tests are performed with jest where msw helps avoid mocking http requests, both server and client, which allows for easier integration tests.

# Committing Changes
[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) makes [git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) sharable within a project while also ensuring code conventions are enforced. The hook is installed during `npm install` and should require no further setup.

Husky pre-commit is configured to run the npm task `pre-commit` which does the following:
- Avoid commits to master/main
- Format staged code
- Lint staged code

Should the need arise to ignore the hook, manually commit using `--no-verify`

```shell
# Example
git commit -m "commit message" --no-verify
```
